## Overview

The Redkey Operator controller-manager exposes a Prometheus-compatible `/metrics` endpoint powered by [controller-runtime's metrics server](https://pkg.go.dev/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/metrics/server). By default, this endpoint serves over **HTTPS on port 8443** with authentication and authorization enforced via Kubernetes TokenReview and SubjectAccessReview APIs.

The metrics endpoint publishes two categories of metrics:

1. **Standard controller-runtime metrics** — operational health of the reconciler, work queues, and the Kubernetes API client.
2. **Custom business metrics** (proposed) — domain-specific signals about RedkeyCluster lifecycle, configuration changes, and readiness latency.

## Enabling and Disabling Metrics

### Command-Line Flags

The controller-manager binary accepts the following flags to control metrics behavior:

| Flag | Default | Description |
| ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `--metrics-bind-address` | `0` (disabled) | Address the metrics endpoint binds to. Use `:8443` for HTTPS or `:8080` for HTTP. Set to `0` to disable. |
| `--metrics-secure` | `true` | Serve metrics over HTTPS. Set to `false` to use plain HTTP. |
| `--metrics-cert-path` | `""` | Directory containing custom TLS certificates for the metrics server. |
| `--metrics-cert-name` | `tls.crt` | Certificate file name within `--metrics-cert-path`. |
| `--metrics-cert-key` | `tls.key` | Key file name within `--metrics-cert-path`. |

When `--metrics-secure=true` (the default), the server uses controller-runtime's `filters.WithAuthenticationAndAuthorization` filter, which requires clients to present a valid bearer token with permission to `GET /metrics`.

When no custom certificate is provided via `--metrics-cert-path`, controller-runtime automatically generates self-signed certificates. This is suitable for development but **not recommended for production**.

### Kustomize Configuration

The default deployment enables metrics via the kustomize patch in `config/default/manager_metrics_patch.yaml`:

```yaml
- op: add
  path: /spec/template/spec/containers/0/args/0
  value: --metrics-bind-address=:8443
```

To **disable metrics**, remove this patch from `config/default/kustomization.yaml` or set the value to `--metrics-bind-address=0`.

To **use cert-manager certificates**, uncomment the `[METRICS-WITH-CERTS]` section in `config/default/kustomization.yaml`, which adds the `cert_metrics_manager_patch.yaml` patch to mount certificates from a cert-manager-managed Secret.

### Helm Chart

When deploying via the Helm chart (`charts/redkey-operator`), metrics are enabled by default through the Deployment args. You can override the metrics bind address and TLS settings through the chart values or by customizing the Deployment template.

### RBAC for Metrics

The following RBAC resources are required for the metrics endpoint to function with authentication:

| Resource | Kind | Purpose |
| -------- | ---- | ------- |
| `metrics-auth-role` | ClusterRole | Grants permission to create `tokenreviews` and `subjectaccessreviews` (required by the metrics server to validate client tokens). |
| `metrics-auth-rolebinding` | ClusterRoleBinding | Binds `metrics-auth-role` to the controller-manager ServiceAccount. |
| `metrics-reader` | ClusterRole | Grants `GET` access to the `/metrics` non-resource URL. Bind this to any ServiceAccount or user that needs to scrape metrics. |

These are included by default in `config/rbac/kustomization.yaml`. To disable authentication on the metrics endpoint, remove these resources and set `--metrics-secure=false`.

### NetworkPolicy

An optional NetworkPolicy (`config/network-policy/allow-metrics-traffic.yaml`) restricts access to the metrics port (`8443`) to pods running in namespaces labeled with `metrics: enabled`. To enable it, uncomment the `../network-policy` line in `config/default/kustomization.yaml`.

### Prometheus ServiceMonitor

A ServiceMonitor for Prometheus Operator is provided in `config/prometheus/monitor.yaml`. It targets the metrics service on port `https` (8443) using bearer token authentication with `insecureSkipVerify: true` by default.

For production, enable the TLS patch (`config/prometheus/monitor_tls_patch.yaml`) which configures proper certificate verification using the cert-manager-managed `metrics-server-cert` Secret.

## Querying Metrics

### Via Port-Forward

From your local machine, forward the metrics service port and query it with `curl`:

```shell
# Grant the controller ServiceAccount permission to read metrics
kubectl create clusterrolebinding redkey-operator-metrics-binding \
  --clusterrole=redkey-operator-metrics-reader \
  --serviceaccount=redkey-operator:redkey-operator-controller-manager

# Forward the metrics service port
kubectl -n redkey-operator port-forward \
  svc/redkey-operator-controller-manager-metrics-service 8443:8443
```

In a separate terminal:

```shell
# Get a bearer token
TOKEN=$(kubectl -n redkey-operator create token redkey-operator-controller-manager)

# Query all metrics
curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://127.0.0.1:8443/metrics

# Quick-check reconcile metrics
curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://127.0.0.1:8443/metrics \
  | grep controller_runtime_reconcile_total
```

### From a Pod Inside the Cluster

Launch a temporary pod in the operator namespace using the controller-manager's ServiceAccount:

1. Grant metrics read access (if not already done):

    ```shell
    kubectl create clusterrolebinding redkey-operator-metrics-binding \
      --clusterrole=redkey-operator-metrics-reader \
      --serviceaccount=redkey-operator:redkey-operator-controller-manager
    ```

2. Run a temporary curl pod:

    ```shell
    kubectl -n redkey-operator run curl-metrics \
      --restart=Never \
      --image=curlimages/curl:latest \
      --overrides='{
        "apiVersion": "v1",
        "spec": {
          "serviceAccountName": "redkey-operator-controller-manager",
          "containers": [{
            "name": "curl",
            "image": "curlimages/curl:latest",
            "command": ["/bin/sh", "-c"],
            "args": [
              "TOKEN=$(cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token); curl -k -H \"Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}\" https://redkey-operator-controller-manager-metrics-service.redkey-operator.svc.cluster.local:8443/metrics"
            ]
          }]
        }
      }'
    ```

3. Check the output and clean up:

    ```shell
    kubectl -n redkey-operator logs -f pod/curl-metrics
    kubectl -n redkey-operator delete pod curl-metrics
    ```

> **Note:** Since the pod runs in the same namespace, you can also use the short service name: `https://redkey-operator-controller-manager-metrics-service:8443/metrics`.

> **Note:** If the `allow-metrics-traffic` NetworkPolicy is active, the source namespace must have the label `metrics: enabled`.

### Useful Filter Commands

To list all controller-runtime, workqueue, and REST client metric families:

```shell
curl -sk -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://127.0.0.1:8443/metrics \
  | grep -E '^(# HELP|# TYPE|controller_runtime_|workqueue_|rest_client_)'
```

To list only the unique metric names (no samples or labels):

```shell
curl -sk -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://127.0.0.1:8443/metrics \
  | grep -E '^(controller_runtime_|workqueue_|rest_client_)' \
  | cut -d'{' -f1 \
  | cut -d' ' -f1 \
  | sort -u
```

## Standard Metrics (controller-runtime)

These metrics are automatically exposed by controller-runtime and require no additional instrumentation.

### Controller Reconciliation Metrics (`controller_runtime_*`)

| Metric | Type | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ----------- |
| `controller_runtime_reconcile_total` | Counter | Total number of reconciliations per controller and result. |
| `controller_runtime_reconcile_errors_total` | Counter | Total number of reconciliation errors per controller. |
| `controller_runtime_terminal_reconcile_errors_total` | Counter | Total number of terminal (non-retryable) reconciliation errors. |
| `controller_runtime_reconcile_time_seconds` | Histogram | Time taken by each reconciliation, per controller. |
| `controller_runtime_max_concurrent_reconciles` | Gauge | Maximum number of concurrent reconciles per controller. |
| `controller_runtime_active_workers` | Gauge | Number of currently active workers per controller. |

### Work Queue Metrics (`workqueue_*`)

| Metric | Type | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ----------- |
| `workqueue_depth` | Gauge | Current depth of the work queue. |
| `workqueue_adds_total` | Counter | Total number of items added to the queue. |
| `workqueue_queue_duration_seconds` | Histogram | Time an item spends waiting in the queue before being processed. |
| `workqueue_work_duration_seconds` | Histogram | Time spent processing an item from the queue. |
| `workqueue_unfinished_work_seconds` | Gauge | Time that unfinished work has been in progress. |
| `workqueue_longest_running_processor_seconds` | Gauge | Duration of the longest running processor. |
| `workqueue_retries_total` | Counter | Total number of retries handled by the queue. |

### Kubernetes API Client Metrics (`rest_client_*`)

| Metric | Type | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ----------- |
| `rest_client_requests_total` | Counter | Total number of HTTP requests to the Kubernetes API server, partitioned by status code and method. |

### What to Monitor in Production

These standard metrics cover the **operational health** of the operator process. The most useful signals for production alerting are:

- **`controller_runtime_reconcile_errors_total`** — the most direct signal that the reconciler is failing. Filter by the `redkeycluster` controller name.
- **`controller_runtime_reconcile_time_seconds`** — reconcile latency. A rising trend without a corresponding increase in load may indicate slow API calls or heavier logic.
- **`controller_runtime_reconcile_total`** — useful for distinguishing normal reconcile volume from requeue storms.
- **`workqueue_depth` and `workqueue_retries_total`** — backlog and retries. A growing queue that does not drain indicates the controller is saturated or blocked.
- **`workqueue_queue_duration_seconds` and `workqueue_work_duration_seconds`** — item wait time and processing time.
- **`controller_runtime_active_workers` vs `controller_runtime_max_concurrent_reconciles`** — worker pool saturation.
- **`rest_client_requests_total`** — pressure and errors against the API server. Error spikes often correlate with control-plane issues.

> **Important:** These metrics tell you whether the operator is healthy as a process, not whether your product is healthy. For example, you can have fast, error-free reconciles while your clusters remain stuck in `Configuring` or `Error` indefinitely.
