## 4. Miscellaneous

### **a. Independent Contractors**

The relationship of the parties under this Agreement is that of independent contractors, and neither party will have the right to act as the agent of the other party.

#### **b. Entire Agreement**

This Agreement is the only agreement that covers this topic. It replaces any previous negotiations or agreements about the same subject matter.

In the event that any provision is held to be invalid, such provision shall be modified to make it enforceable. Notwithstanding the invalid provision, the remainder of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

If the provision cannot be modified, it shall be deemed not to have been made, and the remainder of the Agreement shall be construed in a manner that best reflects the original intent of the parties.

#### **c. Prevalence**

If you have another separate agreement with INDITEX on the same subject, that separate agreement will take priority, e.g, if you are an INDITEX Provider your Contribution will be governed by the INDITEX's Providers Terms of Conditions

If that separate agreement doesn't grant the same rights as this one, the intellectual property terms in this Agreement will still apply.

These separate agreements don't affect others involved in the Project.

#### **d. Modifications**

Any changes to this Agreement must be in writing to be valid.
