## Overview

A **Redkey Cluster** is a key/value cluster built from either the [Redis official image](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis) or the [Valkey official image](https://hub.docker.com/r/valkey/valkey/). All nodes in the same cluster must use the same image family.

**Redkey Operator** deploys and manages Redkey clusters on Kubernetes by implementing the [operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It extends the Kubernetes API with a controller that reconciles the desired state declared in the `RedkeyCluster` resource, manages the Kubernetes objects required by the cluster, coordinates Redis-side operations through Redkey Robin, and keeps the cluster healthy during lifecycle changes.

Redkey Operator is built using [kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder) and [operator-sdk](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk).

## Key Features

- Deploy Redkey clusters from a single `RedkeyCluster` custom resource using Redis or Valkey images
- Configure topology with a selectable number of primaries and replicas per primary
- Run ephemeral or persistent clusters with configurable storage size, storage class, access modes, and PVC cleanup behavior
- Scale clusters up and down while reassigning slots and preserving cluster balance
- Choose between fast operations and key-preserving rebalance flows through `purgeKeysOnRebalance`
- Roll out changes to node image, Redis configuration, and pod resources
- Continuously reconcile cluster state, surface status and substatus, and recover from unhealthy conditions
- Configure authentication, labels, PodDisruptionBudgets, and Kubernetes resource requests and limits
- Deploy and tune Redkey Robin for Redis-side orchestration, health supervision, and metrics collection
- Override generated StatefulSet and Service manifests for platform-specific customization
- Use RedisGraph-compatible images when the workload requires it

## Quick Start

### Using Helm Charts

Prerequisites:

- A running Kubernetes cluster (currently tested with Kubernetes v1.33)
- `kubectl` matching the cluster version
- Helm (v3.0+)

The project provides Helm charts to easily deploy the Redkey Operator and a sample Redkey Cluster. The charts are located in the `charts` directory of the repository.

Install the Redkey Operator using the provided Helm chart:

```bash
helm install redkey-operator ./charts/redkey-operator
```

Install a sample Redkey Cluster using the provided Helm chart:

```bash
helm install my-redkey-cluster ./charts/redkey-cluster
```

Take a look at the [charts/README.md](./charts/README.md) for more details on how to use the Helm charts, including how to enable the post-install hook in the redkey-cluster chart to wait for the cluster to be ready after installation.

### Using Makefile

Prerequisites:

- A running Kubernetes cluster (Kubernetes v1.33+ recommended)
- `kubectl` matching the cluster version
- Make
- Go 1.26.2 (project configured to install easily using asdf or mise)

The operator can be installed using the provided Makefile. The following steps will guide you through the installation and deployment of a sample Redkey Cluster. Redkey Operator can be installed in any namespace, but for this quick start we will use the `redkey-operator` namespace.

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/InditexTech/redkeyoperator.git
cd redkeyoperator
```

Generate and install the CRDs:

```bash
make install
```

Deploy the operator in the cluster (replace `${VERSION}` with the desired version, e.g., `0.1.0`; check the repo releases for available versions):

```bash
make deploy IMG=ghcr.io/inditextech/redkey-operator:${VERSION}
```

Create a Redkey Cluster (replace `${VERSION}` with the desired version, e.g., `0.1.0`; check the [Redkey Robin](https://github.com/InditexTech/redkeyrobin) repo releases for available versions):

```bash
make deploy-samples IMG_ROBIN=ghcr.io/inditextech/redkey-robin:${VERSION}
```
